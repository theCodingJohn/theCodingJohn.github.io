This is my personal website built with react.js. Yes, I know it's not SEO friendly, so I plan to rebuilt it with GatsbyJS or NextJS.

## Tools 
- React
- SCSS
- Spotify API
- Netlify (Deployment)

## Environment Variables 
- REACT_APP_REFRESH_TOKEN
- REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_AUTHORIZATION

## Build Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Runs the app in the development mode.
$ yarn start

# Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
$ yarn test

# Builds the app for production to the build folder.
$ yarn build
```
